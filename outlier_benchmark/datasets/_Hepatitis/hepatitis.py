    This dataset has been taken from [1]_. Details and results for benchmark algorithms may also be found there.
    The dataset provided here is a copy of the dataset taken from the
    `accompanying homepage <https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/research/outlier-evaluation/DAMI/>`_.

    No further preprocessing has been applied. The file is named semantic/Hepatitis/Hepatitis_withoutdupl_05_v01.arff in the
    collection of [1]_.

    Usage:

    >>> from outlier_benchmark.datasets import hepatitis
    >>> X, y = hepatitis.load(download=True)  # download will only take place if not previously downloaded
    >>> X.shape  # (70, 19)
    >>> y.sum()  # 3, the number of outliers in the dataset
    >>> X.max()  # 420.0
    >>> X.min()  # 0.0
