    The WBC dataset has the following properties:

    +-----------------------+--------+
    |number of samples:     |   454  |
    +-----------------------+--------+
    |number of features:    |   9    |
    +-----------------------+--------+
    |number of outliers:    |   10   |
    +-----------------------+--------+
    |percentage outliers:   |   2.2 %|
    +-----------------------+--------+
    |number of duplicates:  |   231  |
    +-----------------------+--------+


    This dataset has been taken from [1]_. Details and results for benchmark algorithms may also be found there.
    The dataset provided here is a copy of the dataset from the
    `accompanying homepage <https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/research/outlier-evaluation/DAMI/>`_.

    No further preprocessing has been applied. When you call wbc.load(), the data is not normalized and contains
    duplicates.

    Usage:

    >>> from outlier_benchmark.datasets import wbc
    >>> X, y = wbc.load(download=True)  # download will only take place if not previously downloaded
    >>> X.shape  # (454, 9)
    >>> y.sum()  # 10, meaning 10 outliers in the dataset
    >>> X.max()  # 10.0
    >>> X.min()  # 1.0
