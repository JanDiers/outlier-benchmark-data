Callbacks
=========

Callbacks provide a uniform way to preprocess your data after loading. We provide you a range of common transformation
methods in the :doc:preprocessing module.

However, sometimes you need further transformation tasks. You can implement Callbacks easily on your own and add it to
your data loading pipeline. Find an example in the BaseCallback Class.
